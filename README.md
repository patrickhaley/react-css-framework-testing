# React UI Framework Testing
This is just a repo for testing out different React UI frameworks. You probably won't find anything useful here.

## Frameworks
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

### Material UI
This was my favorite framework to use. It was easy to use and had a lot of components. The documentation was also very good. I'll probably start here for future projects and look at some of the pro templates to kickstart projects.

https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/

```
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

**Pros:**
- Well-documented API
- Consistency
- Customization

**Cons:**
- Large bundle size
- Lack of flexibility
- Learning curve

### Ant Design
I really like the components available in this framework and they have some unqiue ones like QR codes that would be really useful for my use cases. The documentation was also very good. I'll probably use this for future projects as well. I can see this being more powerful than Material UI, but knowing myself I would probably spend too much time customizing everything.

https://ant.design/docs/react/getting-started

```
npm install antd --save
```

**Pros:**
- Well-documented API
- Active development
- Good performance

**Cons:**
- Over-engineering
- Design limitations

### React Bootstrap
This was my least favorite framework to use. I didn't like the components available and the documentation was lacking. I also had a lot of trouble with the CSS and getting things to look right. I would not use this for future projects. There are not really any issues with Bootstrap itself, but I've just never been a fan of it for CSS and I'm still not a fan for React.

https://react-bootstrap.github.io/docs/getting-started/introduction

```
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

**Pros:**
- Extensive component library
- Highly responsive
- Easy integration

**Cons:**
- Additional dependencies
- Incompatibility with older browsers
- Potential conflicts with other libraries

## Final Thoughts
I think I'll be using Material UI and Ant Design for future projects. I'll probably start with Material UI and then switch to Ant Design if I need more components.
